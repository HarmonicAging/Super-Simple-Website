            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <p>Have questions or feedback about our vibration treatments? Here we address the pros, cons, and common questions.</p>
            <h3>1. What is vibration treatment?</h3>
            <p>Vibration treatment is a process that uses controlled vibrations to simulate the natural playing process of a stringed instrument, enhancing its resonance and tone.</p>
            <h3>2. How does the process work?</h3>
            <p>We use a tactile transducer to apply vibrations to your instrument. These vibrations mimic the effects of playing the instrument, accelerating the break-in process and improving sound quality.</p>
            <h3>3. Is vibration treatment safe for my instrument?</h3>
            <p>Yes, our process is safe for all types of stringed instruments, including guitars, violins, cellos, and upright basses. We use controlled settings to ensure the integrity of your instrument.</h3>
